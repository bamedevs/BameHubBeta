# BameHubBeta
BameHub - New hub from me for Roblox, so far, it has only a universal script that works in 95% places. He has a lot cheats: Walkspeed, JumpPower, Special Effects and more...


Today I posted the first version of the hub (v0.1), in which there is only a universal script.
I hope you will enjoy. The hub is absolutely free to use and also does not have a key system.

More soon...

HOW TO INSTALL?
1. Install BameHub 0.1 lua
2. Open this via notebook (or via any text editor)
3. Copy script and paste it in your injector (i use KRNL)
4. Go to any place and execute
5. Enjoy! :)
